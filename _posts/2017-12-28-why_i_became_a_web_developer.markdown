As a current senior at the University of Mary Washington with my degree in Psychology, I started to think about what kind of jobs I could do in the future. I had decided on my degree in psychology because I wanted to work with individuals with substance abuse problems, but I discovered that I needed a backup. In the field of substance abuse, it is very common to get fatigue. It can be a very challenging from a emotional aspect, but also is not a job that can stay at the office. I found myself worrying about how I was going to pay my student loans back, how I would have time to spend with my family, and what I would do when I mentally needed a break. I thought back to the era of Myspace. I was one of those kids that would spend hours editing the code to customize my profile exactly how I wanted it to be. I would create my own layouts and make it so that no one could stop or skip my profile song (which I am sure everyone hated). I was pretty good at that, so I decided to try the free coding boot camp. That’s where I realized that not only is this something I can see myself doing, it's something I find enjoyable. When I discovered that Flatirons had a scholarship for women in tech, I couldn’t turn down the opportunity. After making a pro’s and con’s list, I decided to call up my coding friends who encouraged me to continue on the web developer path. Since starting, I am even more reassured that I have made the correct change in career.
