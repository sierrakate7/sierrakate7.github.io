The analogy for Arrays was that "they are bags, that contain things," and this helps me break it down a little bit. Arrays can be used to store or "hold" things. Essentially an Array is a list. Arrays are objects that store other objects and we have used this in the Tic Tac Toe Labs. We started off arrays by using them to display the rows on our Tic Tac Toe board. The first thing we had to do was define our board as an Array. The board array contained 9 strings. Arrays are enclosed by square brackets and seperated by commas. Arrays can contain different objects, which makes this very useful for when we are coding. When using an array, you have to keep them essentially in the same order unless you do something to change the order. You can also retrieve objects in the array by using their index. The most important thing to note about arrays is that the index does not start with 1, but instead 0. So our first spot on our Tic Tac Toe board was 0. Now there is no way for someone who is not coding to know that, so when creating our Tic Tac Toe board, we set it so that when the user input 1, we knew it actually meant the space with the 0 index.  If we try to retrieve an index that is not in the array, we will get a return of nil. Arrays can get more complex and nested arrays would be an example of this. You can essentially have a list within a list. You can do all kinds of things with arrays and they will continue to be useful through my coding journey.
